Accrual accounting
======

**Asset + Expense = Capital + Revenue + Liability**(借贷平衡)

## 1. Four important elements of accural accounting

**1. Accrued Revenue(应收账款):**: 
- Record revenue, but the cash is yet to be received
- Account receivable
- Asset!
- Happen: Asset(accured revenue) +, Equity +, Revenue +
- Reverse: Asset(cash) +, Asset(accured revenue) -

**2. Unearned Revenue(预收款):**: 
- Received the cash, but I haven't provided the service yet
- Liability! 
- Happen: Asset +, Liability +
- Reverse: Liability -, Equity +, Revenue + 

**3. Accrued Expense(应计费用):**: 
- I should pay, but I havn't paid yet
- Liability! 
- Happen: Liability(Accrued Expense) +, Equity -(Because income is the same, but expense increase), Expense +
- Reverse: Liability(Accrued Expense) -, Asset(Cash) -

**4. Prepaid Expense(预付款):**: 
- I have paid, but I havn't enjoyed the service 
- Asset!
- Happen: Asset(Cash) -, Asset(Prepaid Expense) +
- Reverse: Asset(Prepaid Expense) -, Equity -, Expense + 
- **Equity = Capital + Revenue - Expense**
- When the Revenue is the same, but Expense increases, then the Equity will decreases
