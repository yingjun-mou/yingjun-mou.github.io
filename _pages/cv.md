Bio
=====
I'm currently a rising second year Computer Science MS student at Georgia Tech, specialized in Machine Learning.Interests include NLP, Machine Learning, and how we can create better-structued knolwege graphs to help us learn, teach, and recreate. I am really excited about how NLP can push both our limits of cultural exchange and our limits of understanding of this complex world.

Before stuying computer science, I also stuidied Architectural Design in Columbia University and worked as an architectural designer in one of the top architectural firms in the world Kohn Pedersen Fox designing a supertall office tower. My design background gives me a new way of looking the world, and makes me wonder how AI agent can learn to be creative in the design process.

In my life, I enjoy swimming, travelling, and exploring different cultures. Feel free to write me at ymou32@gatech.edu and thanks for stopping by!
