Bio
=====
I'm currently a rising second year Computer Science MS student at <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, specialized in Machine Learning.Interests include NLP, creative AI, and how we can create better-structued knolwege graphs to help us learn, teach, and recreate. I am really excited about how NLP can push both our limits of cultural exchange and our limits of understanding of this complex world.

Before stuying computer science, I also stuidied Architectural Design in <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> and worked as an architectural designer in one of the top architectural firms in the world <a href="https://www.kpf.com/">Kohn Pedersen Fox</a> designing a supertall office tower. My unique design background gives me a new way of looking the world, and makes me wonder how AI agents can learn to be creative in the design process.

In my life, I enjoy swimming, <a href="https://yingjun-mou.github.io/travel/">travelling</a>, and exploring different cultures. Feel free to write me at ymou32@gatech.edu and thanks for stopping by!
