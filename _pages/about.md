Hi, I am Rui (Rachel) Sun, a Ph.D. student in the Biomedical deparment in Carnegie Mellon University. 

I am working on using signal processing, machine learning and neuroscience to solve clinical problems in [Dr.He](https://www.cmu.edu/bme/helab/)'s lab. 

 Eplipsy is a neuological disorder affecting more than 1% of the human population. Patients diagnosed with epilepsy suffer from recurrent and unprovoked seizures and it is caused by abnormal brain excitition. I try to decode brain activity patterns using invasive and non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, to further understand the physiological and pathological features of eplipsy. We are trying to answer three questions:

* What are the electrophysiology patterns of EEG during seizure?
* Where is the source of the seizure?
* How is different brain areas connected and how this affect the propagation of the brain signals in the brain.
